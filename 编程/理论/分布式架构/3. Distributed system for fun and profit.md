# Distributed systems at a high level
There are two basic tasks that any computer system needs to accomplish:
- storage and
- computation
> 任何计算机系统都需要完成两项基本任务：存储和计算。

Distributed programming is the art of solving the same problem that you can solve on a single computer using multiple computers - usually, because the problem no longer fits on a single computer.
> 分布式编程是用多台计算机解决在单台计算机上可以解决的同一问题的艺术--通常是因为该问题不再适合在单台计算机上解决。

However, as problem sizes increase you will reach a point where either the hardware upgrade that allows you to solve the problem on a single node does not exist, or becomes cost-prohibitive. At that point, I welcome you to the world of distributed systems.
> 但是，随着问题规模的增大，你将会遇到这样的情况：要么无法升级硬件，让你在单个节点上解决问题，要么成本过高。这时，我欢迎你来到分布式系统的世界。

It is a current reality that the best value is in mid-range, commodity hardware - as long as the maintenance costs can be kept down through fault-tolerant software.
> 目前的现实情况是，只要能通过容错软件降低维护成本，中端商品硬件的价值最高。

Ideally, adding a new machine would increase the performance and capacity of the system linearly. But of course this is not possible, because there is some overhead that arises due to having separate computers. Data needs to be copied around, computation tasks have to be coordinated and so on. This is why it's worthwhile to study distributed algorithms - they provide efficient solutions to specific problems, as well as guidance about what is possible, what the minimum cost of a correct implementation is, and what is impossible.
> 在理想情况下，增加一台新机器可以线性地提高系统的性能和容量。但这当然是不可能的，因为拥有独立的计算机会产生一些开销。数据需要复制，计算任务需要协调等等。这就是为什么值得研究分布式算法的原因--它们为特定问题提供了高效的解决方案，并指导我们了解哪些是可能的，正确实现的最低成本是多少，以及哪些是不可能的。

## What we want to achieve: Scalability and other good things
[Scalability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability)：is the ability of a system, network, or process, to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
> 可扩展性：是指一个系统、网络或流程能够以适当的方式处理不断增长的工作量，或能够扩大以适应这种增长的能力。

- Size scalability: adding more nodes should make the system linearly faster; growing the dataset should not increase latency
- Geographic scalability: it should be possible to use multiple data centers to reduce the time it takes to respond to user queries, while dealing with cross-data center latency in some sensible manner.
- Administrative scalability: adding more nodes should not increase the administrative costs of the system (e.g. the administrators-to-machines ratio).
> 
规模可扩展性：增加节点应使系统的速度呈线性增长；数据集的增长不应增加延迟
地理可扩展性：应该可以使用多个数据中心来减少响应用户查询所需的时间，同时以某种合理的方式处理跨数据中心的延迟。
管理可扩展性：增加节点不应增加系统的管理成本（如管理员与机器之比）。

A scalable system is one that continues to meet the needs of its users as scale increases. There are two particularly relevant aspects - performance and availability - which can be measured in various ways.
>可扩展系统是指随着规模的扩大，仍能满足用户需求的系统。有两个特别相关的方面--性能和可用性--可以通过各种方式来衡量。

### Performance (and latency)
[Performance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance): is characterized by the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used.
> 性能：是指计算机系统完成的有用工作与所用时间和资源的比较。

Depending on the context, this may involve achieving one or more of the following:
- Short response time/low latency for a given piece of work
- High throughput (rate of processing work)
- Low utilization of computing resource(s)
> 根据具体情况，这可能涉及实现以下一个或多个目标：
	特定工作的响应时间短/延迟低
	高吞吐量（处理工作的速度）
	计算资源利用率低

There are tradeoffs involved in optimizing for any of these outcomes. For example, a system may achieve a higher throughput by processing larger batches of work thereby reducing operation overhead. The tradeoff would be longer response times for individual pieces of work due to batching.
> 在对上述任何结果进行优化时，都需要权衡利弊。例如，系统可以通过处理更大批量的工作来获得更高的吞吐量，从而减少运行开销。但这样做的代价是，由于批量处理，单个工作的响应时间会更长。

Latency: The state of being latent; delay, a period between the initiation of something and the occurrence.
> 延迟：潜伏状态；延迟，某事开始和发生之间的一段时间。

Let's assume for a moment that our distributed system does just one high-level task: given a query, it takes all of the data in the system and calculates a single result. In other words, think of a distributed system as a data store with the ability to run a single deterministic computation (function) over its current content:
`result = query(all data in the system)`
> 让我们假设一下，我们的分布式系统只完成一项高级任务：给定一个查询，它获取系统中的所有数据并计算出一个结果。换句话说，可以把分布式系统看作是一个数据存储库，能够对其当前内容进行单次确定性计算（函数）：
	结果 = 查询（系统中的所有数据）

Then, what matters for latency is not the amount of old data, but rather the speed at which new data "takes effect" in the system. For example, latency could be measured in terms of how long it takes for a write to become visible to readers.
> 因此，对延迟而言，重要的不是旧数据的数量，而是新数据在系统中 "生效 "的速度。例如，延迟可以用写入到读者可见所需的时间来衡量。

In a distributed system, there is a minimum latency that cannot be overcome: the speed of light limits how fast information can travel, and hardware components have a minimum latency cost incurred per operation (think RAM and hard drives but also CPUs).
> 在分布式系统中，有一个无法逾越的最低延迟时间：光速限制了信息的传播速度，而硬件组件每次操作都会产生最低延迟成本（例如内存和硬盘，但也包括 CPU）。

How much that minimum latency impacts your queries depends on the nature of those queries and the physical distance the information needs to travel.
> 最小延迟对查询的影响程度取决于查询的性质和信息需要传输的物理距离。

### Availability (and fault tolerance)
[Availability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability): the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be unavailable.
> 可用性：系统处于正常运行状态的时间比例。如果用户无法访问系统，则称系统不可用。
